# IsisAcquisitionDemo
Basic scanner selection and acquisition using Atalasoft's ISIS components.

This is a slightly scaled down ISIS version of our TWAIN Acquisition Demo. Its main 
purpose is to demonstrate the basics of how select from available ISIS scanners, and 
how to control various basic settings like pixel format, resolution, and whether or 
not to show the device's default scanning dialog.

The source code should provide a solid foundation in understanding how to work with 
our ISIS scanning components, while the running demo provides a quick means to 
'sanity check' whether your scanner is visible to DotImage.

This is the VB.NET version. We also have a [C# version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_IsisAcquisitionDemo_CS_x86) available.  

## IMPORTANT NOTES
There is no x64 version. This is due to our licensing agreement for the Pixtran resources we ship with our SDK


## Licensing
This demo assumes you have the Atalasoft SDK DotImage SDK along with our ISIS Scanning addon installed and licensed (or you can request a 30 day evaluation when installing/activating).  

## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2019. We use this older Visual Studio as it's the last version that ran natively in x86 for 32 bit compatibility "out of the box". As noted above, the choice to use x86 in TWAIN scanning applications is deliberate as many scanner drivers are not native 64 bit. This gives a wider scanner comptaiblity.

### Pixtran resources
In order to use our ISIS components, you must place the Pixtran resources included with our SDK into the correct location

Please see [INFO: ISIS Scanning Requires PIXTRAN Capture Resources](https://www.atalasoft.com/kb2/KB/50146/INFO-ISIS-Scanning-Requires-PIXTRAN-Capture-Resources) for details


### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.

- Take note of each of the references we've included:
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.dll
    - Atalasoft.dotImage.Isis.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.Lib.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.WinControls.dll
    - Atalasoft.Shared.dll
- Remove those referneces
- Open the NuGet Package Manger from `Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for this Solution`
- Browse for and install  Atalasoft.DotImage.WinControls.x86. It will pull in DotImage Document Imaging (the base SDK) and our windows controls and shared dll
- Browse for and install Atalasoft.DotImage.Isis.x86. It will pull in the needed ISIS scanning component.
